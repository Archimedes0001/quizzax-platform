### 1.1 Project Title and Description
**Project Title:** Quizzax Assessment Platform

**Brief Description:**
Quizzax is a secure, web-based assessment platform designed for engineering students. It simplifies the process of taking continuous assessment (CA) quizzes by providing a responsive, interactive interface that offers instant feedback, detailed performance tracking, and a competitive leaderboard system. The platform replaces manual or paper-based testing with a modern, automated solution.

### 1.2 Project Objectives and Scope

2.  **Security**: To ensure only authorized students (verified by matric number) can access assessments.
3.  **Engagement**: To increase student engagement through immediate feedback and gamified elements (leaderboards).
4.  **Analytics**: To provide students and instructors with actionable data on academic performance.

**Scope:**
*   **In-Scope**:
    *   Student authentication module.
    *   Quiz delivery engine (Timer, Randomization, Scoring).
    *   Results and performance tracking dashboard.
    *   Leaderboard functionality.
    *   Support for 4 core engineering subjects.
*   **Out-of-Scope**:
    *   Instructor admin panel (for Phase 1).
    *   Essay-type question grading (AI integration).
    *   Payment processing.
